 const CONSTANT_NAME = value;
 define( 'ORIGIN', [0, 0] );
 define('WIDTH','1140px');
</code>

**Summary**
* A constant is a name that holds a simple value that cannot be changed during the execution of the script. From PHP 7, a constant can hold an array.
* A constant can be accessed from anywhere in the script.
* Use the define() function or const keyword to define a constant.
* Use the define() function if you want to define a constant conditionally or using an expression.

#### One Liners 

1. PHP has four types of variable scopes including local, global, static, and function parameters.
2. Like superglobal variables, you can access constants from anywhere in the script.
